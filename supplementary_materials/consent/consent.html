    <h1> Perception of Errors in Visualization Design</h1>

    <p>
      You are invited to participate in a research study how people perceive
      errors in chart designs. You have been asked to participate because we
      need to know what factors determine how easy it is to identify these
      errors, given different types of errors and different chart types.
    </p>

    <p>
      This study will include participants over 18 years of age, without color
      vision deficiency, who feel comfortable using an online interface to read
      graphs and answer questions in English about data.
    </p>

    <p>To reiterate, you are eligible for this study if and only if:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You are comfortable reading/writing in English.</li>
      <li>You have not already completed this survey.</li>
      <li>You are over 18 years of age.</li>
      <li>
        You do not have color blindness or any other color vision deficiency.
      </li>
      <li>You are comfortable with interpreting charts and graphs.</li>
      <li>You have JavaScript enabled in your browser.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What Will My Participation Involve?</h2>

    <p>
      If you decide to participate in this research you will be asked to answer
      questions about data, using a number of charts or graphs to assist you in
      making decisions. You will be presented with a chart, and then asked about
      the information that the chart displays. We expect this study to take 30
      minutes.
    </p>

    <h2>Are There Any Risks To Me?</h2>

    <p>
      We don't anticipate any risks from participation in this study greater
      than normal activity.
    </p>

    <h2>Are There Any Benefits To Me?</h2>

    <p>There are no direct benefits to you other than compensation.</p>

    <h2>Will I Be Compensated For My Participation?</h2>

    <p>
      You will receive $6.00 for participating in this study. If you do withdraw
      prior to the end of the study, you will receive no compensation.
    </p>

    <h2>How Will My Confidentiality Be Protected?</h2>

    <p>
      While there will probably be publications as a result of this study, your
      name will not be used. Only group characteristics will be published.
    </p>

    <h2>Whom Should I Contact If I Have Questions?</h2>
