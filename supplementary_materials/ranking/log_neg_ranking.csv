349,5c665e1948985d0001f09675,Text,Log Neg,negative values in the data but a logarithmic scale is used,1,3,2,4,Visual text is enough to find the error
358,5c66cc9246bfc200019044b8,TextLint,Log Neg,Negative values in a logarithmic scale.,1,2,3,4,The graph needs to clear when you look at it.
362,5cab8cadd0f9c90016b178b0,TextLint,Log Neg,Graph does not use logarithmic scale.,1,2,3,4,Visual is enough to comprehend the mistake occured here.
311,5d5ef4b0cb2426001974ad74,TextLint,Log Neg,Text,2,1,4,4,Text prob
314,5c6693d3a3636800013e2a5b,Visual,Log Neg,NEGATIVE values wihtin the graph,2,1,3,4,Text is very easy at explaining the following error. I wouldn't have got that from visual
315,56f340a6d70ab40006682a5e,Text,Log Neg,"There are negative values in the data, but a logarithmic scale is used.",2,3,1,4,The visual plus text makes the most sense but the visual on its own is also very helpful.
321,5d150669b296b500187df8f9,TextLint,Log Neg,Negative values are in the scale,2,3,1,4,You need the arrow to show where the error is
325,5dc38919dcc83f28ec7970a9,Visual,Log Neg,There was a negative value and the wrong scale was being used.,2,3,1,4,I would have never seen the negative value without the arrow.
326,de,Text,Log Neg,Text and visual ,2,1,4,4,Because negative values in the text make this graph useless 
331,5bf716d84cf1db0001aa80d8,Visual,Log Neg,The x axis scale is incorrect,2,3,1,4,I wouldn't necessarily understand text or visual on its own without context of what the graph is about
332,5cb72e7625f45e0017c31287,Visual,Log Neg,negative values in the data,2,3,1,4,Visual + text
333,5c613f2859ec1d0001fe6ea8,Visual,Log Neg,there are negative values in the data but a logarithmic scale iis being used,2,3,1,4,text+visual was the quickest to make me understand the issue
343,5a49d6a06d85f80001c25bc4,TextLint,Log Neg,it's saying something about negative data values but this is not true -  the data values go to 0 - there are no negative values shown. I understand about the logarithmic scale but I don't see the relationship to the error,2,3,4,4,it erroneously says there are negative data values shown - 
344,5d70ec2138ac7e00012f817b,TextLint,Log Neg,Visual,2,1,3,4,The text is easily understood and helps us find the error quickly
350,5cc99062d918560016acf,TextLint,Log Neg,Text + Visual,2,3,1,4,"I was able to formulate and effective decison I believed, and thought this was useful"

368,5d02e8a7c087120001942ae7,Visual,Log Neg,There are negative values in the data but  logarithmic scale is being used.,2,1,3,4,Text explains this issue the best explaining it easily. Option 2 adds a little more detail whereas option 3 doesn't offer much.
370,5c5f933f59ec1d0001fe64e7,TextLint,Log Neg,Negative values in the data,2,3,4,4,I am confused on this one I guess I don't quit understand what is going on in the image itself
312,5c2d3ba4731cd10001b647d7,TextLint,Log Neg,doesn't denote negative values,3,1,2,4,the text speaks more to the error rather than the visual since the negative sign is missing
313,5a68c6e431b87a0001c753d6,Visual,Log Neg,There were negative values in the data but the negatives were not recorded on the graph,3,2,1,4,i like that the visual clearly shows you the error and I like how the text explains this in detail so that you cannot mistake what the error is. (graph has shown up in this one - no graph/text/visual was showing up during the previous question)
316,5d7192103785810001af02a6,Text,Log Neg,There are negative values in the data but logarithmic scale is being used.,3,2,1,4,I prefer being able to see what's wrong along with more information text wise.
317,5c2677e6ec10810001431001,TextLint,Log Neg,Negative values in data while logarithmic scale is used.,3,2,1,4,"Most people don't know about logarithmic scales, so you would need the text and the visual to show the error."

327,5d2249547afc290017e5a8f9,Text,Log Neg,"there are negative values in the data , but a logarithmic scale is being used ",3,2,1,4,text and visual clearly explained the error 
329,5dbc5143859674000ebbe28c,Visual,Log Neg,There are negative values in the data but a logarithmic scale is being used,3,2,1,4,I think text and visual is most helpful because the visual is loud and calls attention and the text explains. I think text helps more because this is a more complicated answer than the visual can portray

339,5d90be048ff8b4001656a6d9,Text,Log Neg,The graph doesn't show the negative values correctly ,3,2,1,4,Textual explanations are clearer 
340,5c9178d3803bff0001fef762,Text,Log Neg,Logarithmic scale used with negative data,3,2,1,4,Image looks like part of the graph at first and doesn't show what is wrong right away
341,5dd0409d9ca8a312350a4118,Visual,Log Neg,There are negative values in data set but a logarithmic sclae is used. ,3,2,1,4,Visual and text needed to properly explain.
