128,5c6693d3a3636800013e2a5b,Visual,Zero Axis,Does not start at zero  and visual ,2,3,1,4,Well having a copy of both details makes it much clearer. Visual and text makes it easier for me to identify
129,56f340a6d70ab40006682a5e,Text,Zero Axis,The y-axis does not start at zero.,2,3,1,4,"The visual plus text makes it most clear, and the visual is intuitive enough on its own."
134,5781511fad1a6c00014658b7,Text,Zero Axis,the y axis doesn't start at 0,2,3,1,4,The visual helps because that could be easily missed by the eye.
138,5a6b4cd2d5d4cb0001d64740,Text,Zero Axis,The y-axis doesn't start at zero,2,3,1,4,"I think it's good to understand why an error is wrong, not just that an error is there. "
140,de,Text,Zero Axis,Text and visual ,2,3,1,4,The axis starting at 0 renders it useless 
142,5c97f7ed18a759001648027a,Visual,Zero Axis,"That the y axis does not start from zero, it starts at 200",2,1,3,4,"I think that the text was enough to instantly know the issue, the visual still doesn't make it 100% obvious"
143,5dbc5143859674000ebbe28c,Visual,Zero Axis,The y-axis does not start at zero,2,3,1,4,I think text and visual is most helpful because the visual is loud and calls attention and the text explains. I think visual helps more because it jumps out more than the text.
145,5bf716d84cf1db0001aa80d8,Visual,Zero Axis,The y axis doesn't start at 0,2,1,3,4,Text is fine for this as its quite straightforward
