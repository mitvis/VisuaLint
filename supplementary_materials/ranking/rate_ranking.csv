261,5d456961810cac00011bbe28,TextLint,Rate,the two y axes change at different rates,1,2,3,4,visual is faster than text to understand concept.
264,de,Text,Rate,Text and visual ,1,3,2,4,The axis changing a different rates is confusing 
270,5cb72e7625f45e0017c31287,Visual,Rate,axes change at different rates,1,3,2,4,visual is most useful in this graph
303,5dbf7e6f5b87704112c41466,Visual,Rate,Visual (The two Y-axes could not co-exist on the same graph with differing units).,1,3,2,4,The visual + text method really helps highlight the issue with having two differing rates on double y-axes.
258,5781511fad1a6c00014658b7,Text,Rate,The two y-axes change at different rates,2,3,1,4,This is an error that may be less obvious so I think the visual cues are much more helpful than text on its own.
266,5c97f7ed18a759001648027a,Visual,Rate,The axis change at different rates,2,3,4,4,I am still unsure 
269,5bf716d84cf1db0001aa80d8,Visual,Rate,There is a problem with the rating of the two axes,2,3,1,4,I wouldn't necessarily understand text or visual on its own without context of what the graph is about
271,5c613f2859ec1d0001fe6ea8,Visual,Rate,the  two y-axes change at different rates,2,3,1,4,visual + text was the quicker to make me understand
275,5bfbf60d18430e000186a0b6,TextLint,Rate,The two axes change at different rates,2,1,3,4,Only the text helped this one. The visual aids are unclear
284,5daa322a47b9d20017a2e968,Visual,Rate,two y axis changes at different rate,2,3,1,4,It's bit hard to tell by only seeing the text and visual only so both are important in this one
306,5d02e8a7c087120001942ae7,Visual,Rate,The two-y axes change at different rates.,2,1,3,4,Option 1 is more ideal and others i would rank all last if i could. Option one give the most information that is required.
308,5c5f933f59ec1d0001fe64e7,TextLint,Rate,The axes change at different rates,2,3,1,4,The visual and text help seeing both at the same time because you can see the change in both.
249,5d5ef4b0cb2426001974ad74,TextLint,Rate,Wrong value,3,1,2,4,No prob
250,5c2d3ba4731cd10001b647d7,TextLint,Rate,axes change at different rates,3,2,1,4,the text explains the error clearly rather than a visual
251,5a68c6e431b87a0001c753d6,Visual,Rate,the numbers along each side change at different rates - data will be innacurate,3,2,1,4,as this error was more complicated it is definitely more beneficial to be shown the error as well as read an explanation of it

256,5db5d65a57839d000d955bae,Visual,Rate,The axises have different rates,3,1,2,4,The visual made it clear there was an error with the axises but not what the error was
257,5cfeea9c4954fe00165895e0,Visual,Rate,The axes change at different rates,3,2,1,4,Text + Visual gives the most information.  Just the visual requires the reader to guess what the specific issue is
260,5d7101657e53bd000148bdef,TextLint,Rate,The axes change at different rates ,3,2,1,4,text and visual combines the best of both methods but text better outlines the detail of the error 
262,5a6b4cd2d5d4cb0001d64740,Text,Rate,The axes change at different rates,3,2,1,4,"I think it's good to understand why an error is wrong, not just that an error is there. "

278,5c9178d3803bff0001fef762,Text,Rate,The axes change at different rates,3,2,1,4,Image looks like part of the graph at first
279,5dd0409d9ca8a312350a4118,Visual,Rate,The y axes go up at different rates. ,3,1,2,4,"Text needed, visual just highlights where the problem is but not what the problem is. "
280,5c3e3f65e466860001c4b785,Text,Rate,the y axis are at different rates,3,2,1,4,being told and shown gives the best directions.
283,5c1026b7e6eb4e0001b2863c,Text,Rate,the axes change at different rates,3,2,1,4,"the visual does not make it obvious that the error is that the axes change at different rates, it just draws attention to them, whereas the text clearly explains it"
