213,5bfbf60d18430e000186a0b6,TextLint, Size,There are negative values associated with the size encodings,1,2,3,4,The red box immediately draws attention to the issue
214,5dbe9709c964f836acbe159c,TextLint, Size,negative values associated with size encodings,1,3,2,4,visual makes the error clear
223,5b222aff59f9620001c109cb,Visual, Size,Negative values with sizes,1,3,2,4,for this visual could be better
230,5d650ee54c485a00018c0747,Text, Size,Wrong use,1,2,3,4,It is not easy to understand

191,56f340a6d70ab40006682a5e,Text, Size,There are negative values associated with the smaller sizes.,2,3,1,4,"The visual plus text makes the most sense, and the visual makes it relatively clear on its own."
197,5d150669b296b500187df8f9,TextLint, Size,There are negative values in there. ,2,3,1,4,I find it easier for the error to be shown using visual and text so i can physically see the error
201,5dc38919dcc83f28ec7970a9,Visual, Size,There are no negative values.,2,3,1,4,With just the text I had no idea where to look.
202,de,Text, Size,Text ,2,1,3,4,Negative values make it confusing too read 
206,5ce7f7ae2aa9590016af2ba7,Text, Size,There are negatives values associated with the size encodings,2,3,1,4,the text and visual provides the most information but #2 is the visual alone as that is less confusing to a layman
207,5bf716d84cf1db0001aa80d8,Visual, Size,Text and visual ,2,3,1,4,It is useful to have as much information given as possible. I also wouldn't necessarily understand just text
208,5cb72e7625f45e0017c31287,Visual, Size,negative values associated,2,3,1,4,visual & text help me to see a error
219,5a49d6a06d85f80001c25bc4,TextLint, Size,the values of length include negative values,2,3,4,4,"I didn't know that wavelength couldn't be negative, so I wouldn't jump to the fact that this is an error. Also, to me, it's much more weird that the sizes of the balls aren't proportional to their values. e.g. 6 = 3 x 2 but the 6 ball isn't 3 times the size of the 2 ball"
222,5daa322a47b9d20017a2e968,Visual, Size,Negative values associated with side coding,2,3,1,4,By visual you can see the error and by text you can understand the error.
226,5cc99062d918560016acf,TextLint, Size,the text,2,1,3,4,it seemed obvious to me
229,5c7ead380ce9a10016fb5ebf,Visual, Size,The -0.5 should have a larger circle than the -2.,2,3,1,4,It is easily spotted by looking the legend.
231,5d9a74f72aae4c031a29af9b,Visual, Size,There are negative values in size encondings.,2,3,1,4,Pointing out the negative values is clear enough but the text makes it even clearer.
239,5cd99cab568b5b0001cc6330,None, Size,There are negative values on the graph,2,3,1,4,Whit text and visual it’s easy to see that there are negative values
242,5c9d2bed010c73001706aeaa,Text, Size,Negative values ,2,3,1,4,"Look at the rankings: Visual and text is most impact, visual alone is number 2 and text alone is least impact."
247,5daf65969975f80015854b5e,Visual, Size,There are negative values associated with size encodings,2,3,1,4,you can immediately see the error with the visual + text. If used only the text the person may not identify as soon as there is an error there
188,5c2d3ba4731cd10001b647d7,TextLint, Size,negative values not represented on the graph,3,2,1,4,the text calls out the missing information or error better than the visual as the negative values aren't represented in the graph
189,5a68c6e431b87a0001c753d6,Visual, Size,there are negative values again that are not able to be shown on the graph,3,2,1,4,"again, i like to be shown the error as well as read a detailed explanation as I don't use graphs often"
190,5c6693d3a3636800013e2a5b,Visual, Size,Negative values associated.,3,2,1,4,The combination of both helps to clearly explain and direct to the error
192,5d7192103785810001af02a6,Text, Size,There are negative values associated with size encodings,3,2,1,4,I think having more information about the error makes it easier to see the mistake.
194,5db5d65a57839d000d955bae,Visual, Size,There are negative values associated with size.,3,2,1,4,The issue is something that can't really be pointed out without text
195,5cfeea9c4954fe00165895e0,Visual, Size,There should not be data with negative sizes,3,2,1,4,Text + Visual gives the most information.  Just the visual requires the reader to guess what the specific issue is
196,5781511fad1a6c00014658b7,Text, Size,there are negative values associated with size encodings,3,2,1,4,The visual on its own doesn't really explain much

203,5d2249547afc290017e5a8f9,Text, Size,there are negative values associated with size encoding,3,2,1,4,visual was too confusing as it could be regarding anything
204,5c97f7ed18a759001648027a,Visual, Size,There are negative values within the size encodings,3,2,1,4,"It was much easier to see when having both the visual and text, the visual did not tell me much for me personally"
205,5dbc5143859674000ebbe28c,Visual, Size,There are negative values associated with size encodings,3,2,1,4,I think text and visual is most helpful because the visual is loud and calls attention and the text explains. I think text helps more because this is a more complicated message than can be portrayed visually.
209,5c613f2859ec1d0001fe6ea8,Visual, Size,There are negative values associated with size encodings,3,2,1,4,Text and visual helped me quickly verify the mistake

211,5d7929cc3dd8fd0001de3b98,TextLint, Size,There are negative values on the keys.,3,2,1,4,It's easier to understand with both the text and the image.

216,5c9178d3803bff0001fef762,Text, Size,Negative values associated with size encoding,3,2,1,4,Circling negative values wasn't immediately obvious what was wrong
217,5dd0409d9ca8a312350a4118,Visual, Size,Negative values should not have a proportional circle. ,3,2,1,4,Text and visual clearly state the problem and highlight where you can find the problem yourself. 
218,5c3e3f65e466860001c4b785,Text, Size,The values have gone into negative ,3,2,1,4,Text and visual help pinpoint the fault 
220,5d70ec2138ac7e00012f817b,TextLint, Size,Text,3,2,1,4,Both Visual and Text help us understand where the error is located at

245,5d287be62a33c100167c93c6,Visual, Size,Negative values associated with size encodings,3,2,1,4,I can't easily understand just based on the graphics. Having both makes it easier.
246,5c5f933f59ec1d0001fe64e7,TextLint, Size,Negative value with size encodings,3,2,1,4,I choose visual and text because you can see whats going on in the picture and piece it together

268,5ce7f7ae2aa9590016af2ba7,Text,Rate,The axes change at different rates,4,1,3,4,The visual looks confusing as it is unclear whether it is part of the original graph so the text alone is most useful
310,5c5e3853de929b0001a4d683,Text,Rate,the axes change at different rates,4,1,3,4,Only with the text helps to understand what is happening
281,5a49d6a06d85f80001c25bc4,TextLint,Rate,the 2 y axes are changing at different rates,,,,4,"I couldn't tell just by scribbling red lines randomly on the graph that it's supposed to be some kind of error. Also, I didn't realize this is even an issue to have a different change rates"
282,5d70ec2138ac7e00012f817b,TextLint,Rate,Visual,,,,4,In this case i think that visual method was the better way of showing the error because we can clearly see where it is

128,5c6693d3a3636800013e2a5b,Visual,Zero Axis,Does not start at zero  and visual ,2,3,1,4,Well having a copy of both details makes it much clearer. Visual and text makes it easier for me to identify

143,5dbc5143859674000ebbe28c,Visual,Zero Axis,The y-axis does not start at zero,2,3,1,4,I think text and visual is most helpful because the visual is loud and calls attention and the text explains. I think visual helps more because it jumps out more than the text.

158,5d70ec2138ac7e00012f817b,TextLint,Zero Axis,Visual,2,3,1,4,I chose Text+Visual because i think they support each other. It's easier for us to have both of them

173,5d4ad488dfd8230018fd0b45,Text,Zero Axis,that it doesn't start at 0,2,3,1,4,both together makes it easier but even just the visual makes it clear what's wrong
