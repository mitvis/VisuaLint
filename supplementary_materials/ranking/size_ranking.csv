219,5a49d6a06d85f80001c25bc4,TextLint, Size,the values of length include negative values,2,3,1,4,"I didn't know that wavelength couldn't be negative, so I wouldn't jump to the fact that this is an error. Also, to me, it's much more weird that the sizes of the balls aren't proportional to their values. e.g. 6 = 3 x 2 but the 6 ball isn't 3 times the size of the 2 ball"
222,5daa322a47b9d20017a2e968,Visual, Size,Negative values associated with side coding,2,3,1,4,By visual you can see the error and by text you can understand the error.
226,5cc99062d918560016acf,TextLint, Size,the text,2,1,3,4,it seemed obvious to me
229,5c7ead380ce9a10016fb5ebf,Visual, Size,The -0.5 should have a larger circle than the -2.,2,3,1,4,It is easily spotted by looking the legend.

205,5dbc5143859674000ebbe28c,Visual, Size,There are negative values associated with size encodings,3,2,1,4,I think text and visual is most helpful because the visual is loud and calls attention and the text explains. I think text helps more because this is a more complicated message than can be portrayed visually.
